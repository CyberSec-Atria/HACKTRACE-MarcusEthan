# Ethan Marcus – HACKTRACE Challenge Portfolio  
**Fictional Persona | Created by CyberSec Club, Atria Institute of Technology**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

This repository was created as a core asset for the **HACKTRACE – TechNOVA** cybersecurity challenge, simulating an **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)** investigation scenario. It features a carefully designed fictional character named *Ethan Marcus*, whose online presence served as the primary investigative surface for participants.

The portfolio was engineered to:

- Represent a believable digital footprint of a cybersecurity professional.
- Provide an immersive, puzzle-driven experience by embedding hidden clues within standard website content.
- Function as a real-time web-based target for OSINT analysis, designed to test and educate participants on information gathering, logical deduction, and digital awareness.

This project was a pivotal part of the HACKTRACE ecosystem, acting as the narrative and technical anchor for the event.
